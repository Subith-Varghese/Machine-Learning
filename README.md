# Machine Learning

### CSGO Game Project :
I implemented classification models for predicting game outcomes based on player and game-related features.

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed a dataset of 97 features, including handling missing values, duplicates, and encoding categorical features using Label Encoding.
* Feature Engineering: Applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature selection and identified the top 20 features most influential in predicting game outcomes.
* Model Building & Evaluation:
  * Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
  * Achieved 85.39% accuracy with Random Forest, 80.83% with Decision Tree, and 75.86% with Logistic Regression.
* Model Optimization: Standardized features using StandardScaler and tuned models to achieve optimal performance.
* Tools & Libraries: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
